## <summary>What is the purpose of copyright?</summary>

There are two purposes, or rationales, for copyright: 

- To incentivize and motivate authors and creators to continue creating by social gains that will result from those works (including commercial and monetary gains). This is called the **utilitarian** rationale.
- To recognize, and protect, the connection authors and creators have with their works. This is called the **author's rights** rationale and is based on a the idea of moral rights. These moral rights ensure authors and creators are credited for their work which preserves the work's integrity.

Copyright systems in many countries draw on both rationales!

Copyright is actually just one of many types of copyright protections available in Canada! Trademarks and patents are other types of protections for your intellectual propertly. In Canada, a **trademark** is a sign that is used to distinguish goods and services from those from other similar goods and services. Trademarks are a way to protect the public from being confused about the source of goods and services. If you've invented something, you might also patent it. In Canada, a **patent** is a legal right that prevents anyone else from making, using , and/or selling your patented invention. To qualify for patent protection in Canada, your invention must be new, useful, and non-obvious.
