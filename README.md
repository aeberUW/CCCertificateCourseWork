# So You Want To Know About Copyright? A Beginner's FAQ

Have you created something recently? Or are you thinking about creating something? Ever wondered about your copyright protections for the things you create? As the creator of creative works, you have copyright rights! 

Copyright and copyright laws can be confusing. You might find yourself asking: 

- How does copyright work?
- What are your rights?
- How do you get copyright?
- How do you maintain your copyright?
- What if you don't want copyright protections and want to share your work?

A quick search for these questions often brings up lots of legal jargon that doesn't make a lot of sense and makes copyright even more confusing. This FAQ is designed to cut through the jargon and get to the big questions you have about copyright in a way that makes sense! Below you will find a beginner's digest to all your questions about copyright! No question is too big or too small.

## What is copyright?

At its core, copyright is the legal term for author's rights. Copyright describes the rights that authors and creators have over their literary and creative works.
  
## What is the purpose of copyright?

There are two purposes, or rationales, for copyright: 

- To incentivize and motivate authors and creators to continue creating by social gains that will result from those works (including commercial and monetary gains). This is called the **utilitarian** rationale.
- To recognize, and protect, the connection authors and creators have with their works. This is called the **author's rights** rationale and is based on a the idea of moral rights. These moral rights ensure authors and creators are credited for their work which preserves the work's integrity.

Copyright systems in many countries draw on both rationales! 

## What can and can't be copyrighted?

What can and can't be copyrighted varies slightly from country to country. In general, literary and artistic works are copyrightable. In Canada, the Copyright Act states that "every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work" so long as it meets the conditions. 

It would be impossible to create an exhaustive list of what can and can't be protected by copyright, but here is a list to give you some examples of what is and isn't protected in Canada.

| **Can**                                                                 | **Cant** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Literary works (e.g., books and poems)                                  | Facts    |
| Databases                                                               | Themes   |
| Computer programs/software                                              | Ideas    |
| Dramatic works (e.g., films and plays)                                  | Concepts |
| Musical works (e.g., sheet music and compositions with or without words) |          |

## If my work is copyrighted does that mean no one else can use it?

While copyright protections in Canada gives creators the sole right to produce/reproduce, perform, and publish works, there are some important exemptions. Without exemptions, many activities such as scholarly reseearch, teaching, and reviewing materials would be difficult. To protect both the author's and public's best interests, certain exemptions are written into the Canadian Copyright Act and called **fair dealing**. In the Copyright Act, fair dealing provides copyright exemptions for activities such as research, private study, education, parody, and satire. Other uses of copyrighted works may also be permitted if they meet the certain requirements. 

To find out more about determining what uses are considered fair under the Fair Dealing exemptions, check out Western University's [Fair Dealing Analysis](https://copyright.uwo.ca/fair_dealing_analysis/index.html).
  
## What about trademarks and patents? Are those the same?

Copyright is actually just one of many types of copyright protections available in Canada! Trademarks and patents are other types of protections for your intellectual propertly. In Canada, a **trademark** is a sign that is used to distinguish goods and services from those from other similar goods and services. Trademarks are a way to protect the public from being confused about the source of goods and services. If you've invented something, you might also patent it. In Canada, a **patent** is a legal right that prevents anyone else from making, using , and/or selling your patented invention. To qualify for patent protection in Canada, your invention must be new, useful, and non-obvious. 

To learn more about **trademarks** in Canada, check out the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's [Trademarks Guide](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/canadian-intellectual-property-office/en/trademarks/trademarks-guide).

## How do I know what type of protection covers my intellectual property?

One of the best ways to know what types of protection(s) your intellectual property can be covered by in Canada is to check out the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's [Intellectual Property in Canada Comparison Chart](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/canadian-intellectual-property-office/en/intellectual-property-canada). This chart covers all the types of intellectual property protections in Canada and will help you identify what your creative work can be protected by!

## How do I get copyright protection for my work?

Unlike other types of intellectual property protection, copyright protection is automatic! In Canada, copyright is automatic as soon as a creative work is in a fixed material form (i.e., as soon as it's written down or recorded somewhere).

## What if I don't want copyright for my work? What if I want to share it openly?

If you don't want to keep your copyright protection and want to share it, you can dedicate your work into the public domain! The public domain is an essential to preserving history, inspiring future generations of creators, and futhering human knowledge. Works can become public domain in different ways: 

- The copyright protections expire
- The work was never entitled to copyright protections (see question about what can't be copyright protected!)
- The copyright holder doesn't comply with formalities to maintain or acquire copyright protection for their work
- The creator dedicates their work to the public domain (note: this has to be done before the copyright has expired)

If you want to dedicate your work to the public domain, you can use the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) public domain designation from Creative Commons. To learn more about the public domain and what that means for you as a creator, check out the [Creative Commons CC0 FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#How_do_I_apply_CC0_to_my_work.3F)
